# Hashtable Repeated Word

Hashtables are an awesome tool to store unsorted information with O(1) write and O(1) lookup complexity

## Challenge

Use a hashtable to find the first repeated word from a string.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Time -> O(n) because each lookup in the hash map is constant time and worst case you'll have to look through all "n" words in the string.
- Space -> O(n) because the parsed array will contain "n" words
