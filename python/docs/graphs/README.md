# Graphs
Graphs are a unique way to organize information where certain items or nodes are related to certain other nodes as well as store some data, often in the form or an adjacency list

## Challenge
Make and implementation of a graph with all common methods

## Approach & Efficiency
With the adjacency list being supported by a hash table all operations are O(n) and space complexity is O(n)

## API
NA
