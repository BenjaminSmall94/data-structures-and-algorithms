# Tree Breadth First
Develop an algorithm that returns a list of Nodes in breadth first order

[Breadth First Search](../../code_challenges/tree_breadth_first.py)

## Challenge
Develop a function that returns a list of node values saved in breadth first order

## Approach & Efficiency
I used recursive function calls and a queue in order to

### Traversals

- **Time** -> O(n) time because in order to save the new list you need to travers through every item in the tree and copy it into the list
- **Space** -> O(n) space because you copy every item in the tree into the list
