# Linked List Insertions
Linked lists are an awesome way to easily add and remove data from the top of a stack in O(1) time.

## Challenge
This Code Challenge 4 required that I design my own linked list class with `insert`, `includes`, and `to_list` methods

## Approach & Efficiency
I used the iterative approach to solving the `includes` and `to_list` methods since you do not have to worry about recursive stack overflow and my brain tends towards iterative solutions as opposed to recursive ones.
